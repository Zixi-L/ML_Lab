#### Who I am 

  I am a master student in data science. 

#### What the project is about

  This is a project that focues on predicting total interactions of a Facebook Page based on 19 features. 

#### Why this is important

  Facebook is one of the most well-knowed company which focus on building communities to bring people closer. Since meaning connection is            important to the growth of the company, it is important to understand which features are significant predictors of total interactions. 

#### What I have found

  From the analysis, it turns out that post time, whether the page pays for marketing, and number of engaged users are some of the most important features. 

  I think the model at least proves that paid market service is not non-significant
